## Setting up a VM
The best way to learn it to get hands-on. 

Virtualization provides a way to run a simulated "guest" system on your "host" device. These guest systems are called virtual machines. Virtual machines (VMs) allow you to experiment with a different (or same) operating system in an isolated environment, where what you do can't harm your host device.

You can host virtual machines yourself using software like [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/content/vmware/vmware-published-sites/us/products/workstation-player.html.html) and Oracle [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). Or you can pay a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or GCP to host virtual machines for you. AWS has a great [free tier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html) that will let you get started. Azure tends to be more expensive, but as a student you may get [free credits](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/). If you are new to cyber, we recommend picking either Windows Server or a common Linux distribution (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc) to get started with. Set up a virtual machine to test with and get your hands dirty.

If hosting your own virtual machines with Workstation Player or VirtualBox, you will need to get a .iso file that contains the installer for the operating system you chose. For example, Ubuntu ISOs can be acquired [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Windows Server ISOs can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter).

In HPCC0, competitors defended Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, Ubuntu 20, and CentOS 7 systems.

## Blue Team Crash Course
As part of Hack@UCF's Fall curriculum leading up to HPCC1, we will be teaching the fundamentals of cyber defense on Linux, Windows, and pfSense. As that curriculum is released, it will find a permanent home here.

In the meantime, here is a [short guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Ozs8XY0mEgFQ3cnbVhd5RV3OmBXIBuZMLhPSGonsuE/edit?usp=sharing) written for HPCC0. The guide is based on a [talk](assets/Hack@UCF_slides_2023-04-07.pdf) given at one of our general body meetings. 

## Linux Security Resources
The overall winning team from 2023 gave a GBM on how they did it, as well as a blog post.

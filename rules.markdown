## Rules

Competitors are expected to abide by the following rules (this list is from the [HPCC3 Blue Team Packet](https://plinko.horse/packet)):

1. **Do not attack infrastructure.** WiFi connections, our virtualization platform OpenStack, scoring agents, scoring platforms, and other competition infrastructure are *explicitly* out of scope. Additionally, do not touch the environments of other teams. If you are found to be attacking or interfering with another competition team, *you will be instantly disqualified*.

2. **Stay in scope.** Only interact with assets that are explicitly in-scope for your team. In-person, in-character interactions with staff of the IHPL (that is, *not* Red Team) are out of scope, and are merely for immersion and fun. Scope will be explained in further detail [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h3O9j2TszS4b1T6N15X5Osj6SZRtNNC9GiwNgdW53AI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.5pot9u5hi9f4).

3. **Do not exfiltrate company data or replace mandated services.** You are not allowed to copy data from the competition environment to your personal device or external websites, nor can you replace scored services with different ones (e.g. changing Apache to nginx).

4. **Respect time-out periods.** During any official breaks, you are not allowed to interact with your environment. Your environment will be automatically closed during these periods. Meet with sponsors, network with others, and relax.

5. **You can use the Internet...** Tools or scripts that are publicly available **and** free are allowed. *Paid tools are not*, including Pro memberships of ChatGPT, Claude, Kagi, or other premium online services. Searching for information you do not know is encouraged, and may even be necessary\! Printed reference materials are also permitted. Scripts created by your team do not have to be public.

6. **â€¦but you cannot plagiarize.** Submitting injects with information copied verbatim from the Internet is strictly prohibited. Additionally, utilizing any AI tools to generate responses for injects (including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Bing Chat) is prohibited.

7. **Please report issues.** If you have a problem during the competition, please contact either White Team or Black Team. You will *not* be penalized for reporting any issues.

8. **Please be nice to everyone.** Do not be rude to the Red Team, Black Team, White Team, or fellow Blue Team members. Do not attempt to social engineer competition organizers; what you say to White or Black Team will not be shared with the Red Team.

9. **Have fun\!** The ultimate goal is to learn, so please show good sportsmanship throughout the competition, even when things are tough.

10. **We reserve the right to disqualify any individual or team** that we, in our sole discretion, hold to be too experienced for the level of difficulty targeted in this beginner-oriented competition. If in doubt, reach out.


*Failure to comply with the above rules will lead to disqualification. For any clarification on the rules, please ask a White Team member. And yes, failing to have fun is a disqualifiable offense. We take our fun seriously at the IHPL.*

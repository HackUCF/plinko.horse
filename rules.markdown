## Rules

**We want to ensure that everything runs smoothly, so please follow all the rules below:**

1.  **Do not attack infrastructure.** WiFi connections, our virtualization platform OpenStack, scoring agents, scoring platforms, and other competition infrastructure are explicitly out of scope. Additionally, do not touch the environments of other teams. If you are found to be attacking or interfering with another competition team, you will be instantly disqualified.

2.  **Do not remove scoring accounts.** The "hkeating" user cannot be removed or tampered with; doing so will cause services to not be scored properly. Red Team will not use these accounts.

3.  **Stay in scope.** Only touch assets inside the shaded green box on the [network diagram](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p81x_F_qo01ULRClNgW039kbOf_zyx-Nm7iPqWwVf6s/edit#heading=h.jtnls5rig68h). In-person, in-character interactions with staff of the IHPL (that is, not Red Team) are out of scope, and are merely for immersion. Scope will be explained in further detail [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p81x_F_qo01ULRClNgW039kbOf_zyx-Nm7iPqWwVf6s/edit#heading=h.5pot9u5hi9f4).

4.  **Respect time-out periods.** During any official breaks, you are not allowed to interact with your environment. Your environment will be automatically closed during these periods. Meet with sponsors, network with others, and relax.

5.  **You can use the Internet...** Non-AI, publicly available free tools are fair game. Paid tools are not. Searching for information you do not know is encouraged, and may even be necessary! Printed reference materials, including print-outs and books, are also permitted.

6.  **...but you can not plagiarize or use AI tools.** Submitting injects with information copied verbatim from the Internet or any AI tools including (but not limited to) ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google Bard is strictly prohibited. Utilizing any AI tools (including as a search aid) is also prohibited. PlinkoAIâ„¢ is the only exception.

7.  **Please report issues.** If you have a problem during the competition, please contact either White Team or Black Team. You will not be penalized for reporting any issues.

8.  **Please be nice to everyone.** Do not be rude to the Red Team, Black Team, White Team, or fellow Blue Team members. Do not attempt to social engineer competition organizers; what you say to White or Black Team will not be shared with the Red Team.

9.  **Have fun!** The ultimate goal is to learn, so please show good sportsmanship throughout the competition, even when things are tough.\

*Failure to comply with the above rules will lead to disqualification.[^1] For any clarification on the rules, please ask a White Team member.*

[^1]: And yes, failing to have fun is a disqualifiable offense. We take our fun seriously at IHPL.

## Compete

To compete you must be age 18 or older and a registered student of any highschool, college, or university.

HPCC is comprised of two identical runs: one on Saturday and one on Sunday. Both runs will be oriented towards beginners and more skilled competitors alike.

For more information on how to sign up, join the [Hack@UCF Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/VwkkDcJ) to stay posted on any announcements as HPCC3 approaches. 

## Become An Organizer

Any UCF student (or incoming UCF student) willing to learn can help organize Horse Plinko. We are seeking students interested in IaC (Infrastructure as Code) tools like Terraform and Ansible, offensive security, OpenStack, network engineering, and more - no matter what you're interested in, we can probably use your help. To get involved, join the [Hack@UCF Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/VwkkDcJ) and ask for more details in the #questions channel.

## Sponsor Us
Sponsors are what keep us running! Every donation is greatly appreciated and recognized as a contribution to our continued success. HPCC has different tiers of sponsorship packages, including a logo on the competition shirts, tabling and speaking opportunities, and even a peg on our real-life plinko board that competition winners get to sign. Properly designated donations made through the Collegiate Cyber Defense Club Incorporated, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, may be tax deductible. For more information on how to become a sponsor, please contact [sponsorship@hackucf.org](mailto:sponsorship@hackucf.org).

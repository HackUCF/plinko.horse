## Compete

To compete you must be age 18 or older and a registered student of any highschool, college, or university. HPCC2 will be part of the [KnightHacks VII hackathon]([https://2024.knighthacks.org]). 

HPCC2 is comprised of two identical runs: one on Saturday Oct. 5th and one on Sunday Oct. 6th. Both runs will be oriented towards beginners and more skilled competitors alike.

To sign up, register for the Knight Hacks VII hackathon [here]([https://2024.knighthacks.org]). After you create your user profile, check the box that says "I am interested in participating in Hack@UCF's Horse Plinko event." We'll contact you closer to the event to register for HPCC2. 

## Become An Organizer

Any UCF student (or incoming UCF student) willing to learn can help organize Horse Plinko. We are seeking students interested in IaC (Infrastructure as Code) tools like Terraform and Ansible, offensive security, OpenStack, network engineering, and more - no matter what you're interested in, we can probably use your help. To get involved, join the [Hack@UCF Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/VwkkDcJ) and ask for more details in the #questions channel.

## Sponsor Us
Sponsors are what keep us running! Every donation is greatly appreciated and recognized as a contribution to our continued success. HPCC has different tiers of sponsorship packages, including a logo on the competition shirts, tabling and speaking opportunities, and even a peg on our real-life plinko board that competition winners get to sign. Properly designated donations made through the Collegiate Cyber Defense Club Incorporated, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, may be tax deductible.
